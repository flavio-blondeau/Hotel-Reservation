## Hotel Reservation Project

This script simulates a Hotel Booking service. Using command line,
customer can select an hotel and proceed to payment using
a credit card.

Hotels, credit cards, and security passwords are stored in csv files.
We have used pandas to access them.

Once a customer had reserved a hotel, the hotel itself become unavailable
if someone else wants to book it.

If you want to try the script, please use the data in the csv files.
You can find there credit cards data (or you can add your own data to the files).
